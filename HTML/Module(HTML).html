  <h3>1) Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h3>
  <p>
    <b>HTML Tags:</b>
    HTML tags are used to define the structure and elements within a web page.
    Tags are composed of angle brackets (< and>) and usually come in pairs: an
      opening tag and a closing tag. Tags are used to enclose content and
      provide instructions to the web browser on how to display that content.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>HTML Elements:</b>
    HTML elements are composed of tags and the content they enclose. An HTML
    element consists of an opening tag, the content (which may include text,
    other elements, or multimedia), and a closing tag. Elements are the
    fundamental building blocks of an HTML document.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h3>2) What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h3>
  <p>
    In HTML, tags and attributes are essential components that are used to
    define and structure web content. They play different roles in specifying
    how content is presented and behaves on a web page: <br />
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <b>HTML Tags:</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      - Tags are the fundamental building blocks of HTML. They are used to
      define and structure content on a web page.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      - Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and>) and usually come in
        pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      - HTML tags are used to create various elements, such as paragraphs,
      headings, lists, links, images, forms, and more. Each tag is associated
      with a specific HTML element.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
    <dt>
      <b>HTML Attributes:</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      - Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML
      elements within their opening tags.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      - Attributes are always specified in the opening tag and consist of a
      name and a value, separated by an equal sign. The attribute name is
      followed by the equal sign and the attribute value enclosed in double or
      single quotes.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      - Attributes serve various purposes, such as defining the source of an
      image, specifying the link destination for an anchor (link) element,
      setting styles, and providing data for form elements.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <br />

  <h3>3) What are void elements in HTML?</h3>
  <p>
    Void elements, also known as self-closing elements or empty elements, are
    a category of HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. Instead of
    having both an opening and closing tag, void elements are written as a
    single self-closing tag, typically ending with a forward slash before the
    closing angle bracket. Void elements are commonly used for including
    things like images, line breaks, input fields, and other elements that
    don't need additional content.
  </p>
  Some common examples of void elements in HTML include:
  <ol>
    <li>
      < img> Used for embedding images.
    </li>
    <li>
      < br> Used to insert line breaks.
    </li>
    <li>
      < input> Used for creating form input fields.
    </li>
    <li>
      < hr> Used to create horizontal rules or thematic breaks.
    </li>
    <li>
      < link> Used for linking external resources, such as stylesheets.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Void elements are a specific subset of HTML elements that have a
    predefined list of attributes and don't require a separate closing tag
    because they can't contain any nested content. They are designed for
    simplicity and efficiency in web development.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h3>4) What are HTML Entities?</h3>
  <p>An HTML entity is used to display invisible characters and reserved characters that would
    otherwise be interpreted as HTML code. It is a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and
    ends with a semicolon ( ; ).
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>5) What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h3>
  <p>There are three different types of HTML lists:
    1. Ordered List or Numbered List (ol)
    2. Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul)
    3. Description List or Definition List (dl)
  </p>
  <p>
    for ex:- (ol)
  <ol>
    <li>Changu</li>
    <li>Mangu</li>
    <li>Bhangu</li>
    <li>Langu</li>
  </ol>

  for ex:- (ul)
  <ul>
    <li>Changu</li>
    <li>Mangu</li>
    <li>Bhangu</li>
    <li>Langu</li>
  </ul>

  for ex:- (dl)
  <dl>
    <dt>Changu</dt>
    <dd>- Bhaiyoon me sabse bada</dd>
    <dt>Mangu</dt>
    <dd>- Bhaiyoon me dusre number pe</dd>
    <dt>Bhangu</dt>
    <dd>- Bhaiyoon me tisre number pe</dd>
    <dt>Langu</dt>
    <dd>- Bhaiyoon me sabse chota</dd>
  </dl>
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>6) What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.</h3>
  <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to
    a class in a style sheet. Class attributes are the variables defined directly in the class that are shared by all
    objects of the class.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>7) What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements With Example.</h3>
  <p>The basic difference between ID and Class is that the ID selector is applied only to one element
    in a page, whereas the class selector can be applied to several elements on a single page.
  </p>
  <p>example:-

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <style>
        /* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
        #myHeader {
          background-color: lightblue;
          color: black;
          padding: 40px;
          text-align: center;
        }

        /* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
        .name {
          background-color: tomato;
          color: white;
          padding: 10px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>

    <body>

      <!-- An element with a unique id -->
      <h1 id="myHeader">My name</h1>

      <!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
      <h2 class="name">Hardik</h2>
      <p>Hardik is my first name.</p>

      <h2 class="name">Solanki</h2>
      <p>Solanki is my last name.</p>

    </body>

    </html>
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>8) What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h3>
  <p>In HTML the formatting tags are divided into two categories: Physical tag: These tags are used to
    provide the visual appearance to the text. Logical tag: These tags are used to add some logical or
    semantic value to the text.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>9) How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h3>
  <p>cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content
    present in it. Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells. One can create it
    using the tag of HTML < table>, but it sets the type attribute to cellpadding.</p>
  <p>for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <style>
        td {
          background: rgb(192, 237, 255);
        }
      </style>
      <title>
        Web table
      </title>
    </head>

    <body>
      <table border="2" cellpadding="15">
        <tr>
          <td>Hardik</td>
          <td>Solanki</td>
          <td>S.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hardik</td>
          <td>Solanki</td>
          <td>S.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </body>

    </html>
    <br>
    for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <style>
        td {
          background: rgb(192, 237, 255);
        }
      </style>
      <title>
        Web table
      </title>
    </head>

    <body>
      <table border="3" cellspacing="25">
        <tr>
          <td>Hardik</td>
          <td>Solanki</td>
          <td>S.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hardik</td>
          <td>Solanki</td>
          <td>S.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </body>

    </html>

  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>10) How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.</h3>
  <p>We use the colspan and rowspan attribute, to merge cells in HTML. The rowspan attribute is for
    the number of rows a cell should merge, whereas the colspan attribute is for the number of columns a cell should
    merge. The attribute should be placed inside the < td> tag.</p>
  <p>
    for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <style>
        table,
        th,
        td {
          background-color: rgb(192, 237, 255);
          border: 1px solid black;
          width: 100px;
          height: 50px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>

    <body>
      <h1>Rowspan merge</h1>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </body>

    </html>

    for ex:-

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <style>
        table,
        th,
        td {
          border: 1px solid black;
          width: 100px;
          height: 50px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>

    <body>
      <h1>Colspan merge</h1>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2"></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </body>

    </html>

  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>11) What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h3>
  <p>
    Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space
    from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML
    element.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>12) How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.</h3>
  <p>
    To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the < a> and < /a> tags, which are the tags used to define
        the links. The < a> tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the </> tag indicates where it ends. Whatever
        text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink.
  </p>
  <p>
    for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <body>

      <h1>Links in HTML</h1>

      <a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google.com</a>

    </body>

    </html>

  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>13) What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.</h3>
  <p>
    The iframe in HTML stands for Inline Frame. The ” iframe ” tag defines a rectangular region
    within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and
    borders. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
  </p>
  <p>
    for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <body>
      <h2>HTML Iframes example</h2>
      <p>Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe:</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jyf0xKzDt8E?si=8MRxKRVLf2AxmOH0"
        title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </body>

    </html>
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>14) What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h3>
  <p>The < span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
      The < span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id
        attribute. The < span> tag is much like the < div> element, but < div> is a block-level element and < span> is
                an inline element.
  </p>
  <p>
    for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <title>Span Tag</title>
    </head>

    <body>
      <h2>Example of span tag</h2>
      <p>I have choosen only
        <span style="color: red;">red</span>,
        <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, and
        <span style="color: green;">green</span> colors for my painting.

      </p>

    </html>

  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>15) How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.</h3>
  <p>
    The easiest method to add a background image to a webpage is using the background attribute in the < body> tag of
      HTML. This will add a background image to the whole page.
  </p>
  <p>
    for ex:-
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <title>
        My Mood Today
      </title>
    </head>

    <body> <!-- adding background image to the entire webpage -->
      <center>
        <h1>How do I feel?</h1>
        <h2>I am happy!</h2>
      </center>
    </body>

    </html>

  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>16) How are active links different from normal links?</h3>
  <p>
    An active link is a link that can be clicked on to take you to another page or website. A passive link is a link
    that can't be clicked on.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>17) What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h3>
  <pre>
    We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:
    
    < br> tag – It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a
      new line.

    < p> tag – This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.

    < blockquote> tag – This tag is used to define large quoted sections.
  </pre>
  <br>

  <h3>18) What is SVG?</h3>
  <p>
    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is used to define graphics for the Web.Scalable Vector Graphics, SVG,
    is a W3C XML dialect to mark up graphics.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>18) What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3>
  <p>
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. XHTML is
    basically an extension of HTML, which is stricter than HTML. Both languages are used to create web and Android
    applications. HTML is SGML based, whereas XHTML is an XML-based language.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3>19) What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h3>
  <p>
    Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better visibility and understanding of the text by
    the user on the web page. However, both tags differ from each other as suggested by their names. Logical Tags :
    Logical Tags are used in HTML to display the text according to the logical styles.
