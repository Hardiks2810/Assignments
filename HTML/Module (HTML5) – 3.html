        2> Canvas and SVG tags
    </p>
    <p>
        VG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with JavaScript).
        SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript
        event handlers for an element. In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object.

        3> How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
    </p>
    <p>
        The HTML5 audio and video tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to
        identify the media source and include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media.

        4> Semantic element in HTML5?
    </p>
    <p>
        A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of
        non-semantic elements: < div> and < span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements:
                < form>, < table>, and < article> - Clearly defines its content.
