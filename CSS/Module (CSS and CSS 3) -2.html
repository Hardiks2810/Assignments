    <p>
        CSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible
        with earlier CSS1 and CSS2.<br>
        The selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors.<br>

        Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target<br>
        Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color,background, position etc.<br>

    <p>
        5> What do you understand by CSS opacity?
    </p>

    <p>
        The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind
        an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        6> How can the background color of an element be changed?
    </p>
    <p>
        To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or
        code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like
        a table, heading, div, or span tag.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        7> How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
    </p>
    <p>
        This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the
        repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both
        horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        8> what is the use of the background-position property?
    </p>
    <p>
        The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a
        background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and
        horizontally.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        9> Which property controls the image scroll in the background?
    </p>
    <p>
        The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page,
        or is fixed.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        10> Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property
        is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
    </p><br>

    </p>
    <p>
        It's centrally align's the block elements, we can simply make use of the < center> tag.

            </center>
    </p><br>

    <p>
        12> How to maintain the CSS specifications?
    </p>
    <p>
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
        text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).
    </p><br>

    <p>
        13> What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use
        Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an
        internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        14> What is embedded style sheets?
    </p>
    <p>
        Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one
        place. This is done by embedding the < style> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your
            document.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        15> What are the external style sheets?
    </p>
    <p>
        An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head
        section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an
        external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        16> What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
    </p>
    <p>
        The advantages of External Style Sheets are as follows :
    <ul>
        <li>
            With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single
            file.
        </li>
        <li>
            In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the
            site.
        </li>
        <li>
            In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.
        </li>
    </ul><br>
    The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are as follows :
    <ul>
        <li>
            An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.

        </li>
        <li>
            The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.
        </li>
        <li>
            While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check
            compatibility issues.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p><br>

    <p>
        17> What is the meaning of the CSS selector?
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be
        selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
